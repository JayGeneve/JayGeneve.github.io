_**[Stock Return Prediction Using Neural Networks](https://lehigh-asset-pricing.streamlit.app)**_

Together with my team I developed the Lehigh Asset Pricing model which uses regressors and neural networks to predict stock returns and build a zero-cost long-short portfolio. Our team processed WRDS CRSP, OpenAP, and Famaâ€“French factor data and selected leading 5,000 firms based on net operating assets before training Lasso, Ridge, HistGradientBoosting, and three MLP architectures through an expanding window methodology. The HistGradientBoosting model led in Sharpe ratios among all methods whereas the 3 fold Neural Network showed the best network performance but the best overall result was obtained from our stacked regressor.

_**[Regression Practice](regression)**_

The regression.ipynb notebook contains a comprehensive walkthrough of linear regression modeling using Python. It demonstrates how to import, clean, and explore data before applying regression techniques to analyze relationships between variables. The notebook includes visualizations and model evaluation metrics, making it a clear and practical guide for learning or showcasing regression analysis.

## Hobbies

I'm passionate about a well-rounded lifestyle that blends adventure, competition, and connection. I love traveling to explore new places and cultures, and when I'm not on the road, you'll often find me on the basketball court, engaging in spirited games. I also enjoy the intellectual challenge of chess and the invigorating routines at the gym. Above all, spending quality time with friends and family is what truly enriches my life.
