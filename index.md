## About Me

I am a senior at Lehigh University pursuing a dual major in Finance and Business Analytics. Passionate for innovation and leveraging data-driven insights to make informed financial decisions, I thrive in the dynamic intersection of finance and technology.

I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to contribute to the success of organizations in the ever-evolving business landscape. Through my coursework and extracurricular involvement, I have honed my ability to collaborate effectively, adapt to changing circumstances, and think critically to solve complex problems.

Committed to continuous learning, I am excited to explore opportunities that allow me to further develop my expertise in finance and technology, while making a positive impact on the financial well-being of individuals and businesses alike.
